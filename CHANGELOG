# Initial Release
- Inital Release of Actualtap-py
- Special Thanks to @MattFaz for the original idea of [ActualTap](https://github.com/MattFaz/actualtap)

# What's Different between this and ActualTap?
- Written in Python
- Uses config.yml file over .env variables
- Saves the request into a wallet.json in your phone so you can re-submit it if you have no internet access
- Allows mapping of Tap to Pay accounts -> Actual account ID via config file
